Drop your ticker/coin logo files here to override the built-in icons.

File naming:
- Use uppercase symbols, PNG preferred.
- Examples: AAPL.png, MSFT.png, BTC.png, ETH.png

Rendering:
- The UI renders these as monochrome using CSS mask (currentColor), so source images can be colored or white-on-transparent.

Note:
- This repo does not bundle any third-party logos by default.
- If you use external logo sets (e.g. nvstly/icons), ensure you have the rights to use and redistribute those assets.
